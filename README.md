# Introduction
This project is a multi-scale neuroscience and machine-learning project exploring how stress and emotion appear across three biological layers: skin-level physiology, EEG brain activity, and microglial gene-expression patterns.

I’ve been really interested in microglia, the immune cells of the brain. What makes them so interesting is that they play two opposite roles: in healthy conditions they regulate inflammation and support neural function, but when they become overactivated by stress or disease, they can fuel inflammation and disrupt brain activity.

This project uses three datasets (WESAD, DENS, and GSE127159) and aims to analyze stress and emotional activation from these different perspectives. 

Ultimately, I try to answer how stress manifests at different biological levels.
